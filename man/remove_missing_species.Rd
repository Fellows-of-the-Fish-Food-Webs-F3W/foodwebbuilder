\title{Remove Species with Missing Data Across Input Tables}
\usage{
remove_missing_species(ind_measure, fish_diet_shift, pred_win)
}
\arguments{
\item{ind_measure}{A data frame containing individual-level measurements
with a column \code{species_code} identifying each species.}

\item{fish_diet_shift}{A data frame containing species dietary information,
with a column \code{species_code}.}

\item{pred_win}{A data frame containing predator window or prey availability
data, with a column \code{species_code}.}
}
\value{
A filtered version of \code{ind_measure} containing only species that appear in
both \code{fish_diet_shift} and \code{pred_win}.
}
\description{
Cleans the individual measurement dataset by removing species that are not
present in the auxiliary datasets (\code{fish_diet_shift} or \code{pred_win}).
This ensures that all species retained have complete information across
all relevant data sources.
}
\details{
The function checks whether each species in \code{ind_measure} is represented in
both reference datasets. Any species missing from either is removed, and a
message is printed listing which species were excluded.
