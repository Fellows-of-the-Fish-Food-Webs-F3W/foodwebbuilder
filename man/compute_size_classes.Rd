\title{Compute Size Class Boundaries for Each Species}
\usage{
compute_size_classes(ind_measure, num_classes)
}
\arguments{
\item{ind_measure}{A data frame of individual-level measurements
containing at least the columns \code{species_code} and \code{size}.}

\item{num_classes}{Integer indicating the number of size classes
to divide each species' observed size range into.}
}
\value{
A data frame listing each species with the corresponding size class
boundaries. The output includes a column for the species code,
a lower bound, and upper bound columns for each class.
}
\description{
Divides the observed body length range of each species into a specified
number of size classes. This is typically used to discretize continuous
size data for subsequent analysis or modeling.
}
\details{
For each species, the function identifies the maximum observed size and
constructs evenly spaced size class intervals from 0 to that maximum.
These intervals are returned in a tabular form suitable for further use
in population or trophic modeling.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
size_classes <- compute_size_classes(ind_measure, num_classes = 5)
head(size_classes)
}
