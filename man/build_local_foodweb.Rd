\title{Build a Local Food Web from a Global Metaweb}
\usage{
build_local_foodweb(
  ind_measure_local,
  metaweb,
  tab_size_classes,
  num_classes,
  selected_resources
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ind_measure_local}{A data frame of local individual‐level
measurements containing the columns \code{species_code} and \code{size}.
Each row represents an observed individual in the local community.}

\item{metaweb}{A global metaweb adjacency matrix (as produced by
\code{\link[=build_metaweb]{build_metaweb()}}) representing all potential interactions among
trophic species and resources.}

\item{tab_size_classes}{A data frame of size‐class boundaries for each
species, typically generated by \code{\link[=compute_size_classes]{compute_size_classes()}}. Must include
a \code{species_code} column and class bounds.}

\item{num_classes}{Integer indicating the number of size classes per
species, matching the value used in \code{\link[=build_metaweb]{build_metaweb()}}.}

\item{selected_resources}{Character vector giving the names of resource
nodes to retain in the local network.}
}
\value{
A square adjacency matrix (data frame or matrix) representing the subset
of the metaweb that corresponds to locally present trophic species and
resources.
}
\description{
Extracts a local food web (subnetwork) from a global metaweb based on the
species and individual sizes observed at a specific site or sample. The
function filters the metaweb to include only the trophic species and
resources present locally.
}
\details{
For each individual observed locally, the function determines which
trophic species (species–size‐class combinations) are represented based
on body size. It then filters the global metaweb to include only those
trophic species and the selected resource nodes, yielding a local‐scale
interaction network.
